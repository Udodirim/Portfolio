# Projects
# **News Intelligence with NLP**

https://github.com/Udodirim/News_Intelligence_with_NLP 

A Streamlit-powered app that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the BBC News dataset. The project classifies articles into subcategories, extracts named entities (with roles like politician, athlete, journalist), highlights media personalities, and summarizes events in April. Built using Python, Streamlit, and GPT-3.5.

# **Visa InfoBot**

https://github.com/Udodirim/Visa_InfoBot 

Visa InfoBot is a conversational app that answers a simple question fast: “Do I need a visa to visit Nigeria?” Users type a country (e.g., Bolivia or How about Iran?). The bot detects the country in the sentence, tells you whether a visa is required, and—if yes—guides you through visa types (Tourist, Business, Student, Visa on Arrival).
It’s built to be data-agnostic: all rules and responses live in a single JSON-like file (Conversation). Swap that file and the same app can serve other countries without code changes. The UI is in Streamlit (with quick-reply chips, chat bubbles, and an Admin sidebar), and there’s a CLI mode for terminal use.

# PySales Query CLI

https://github.com/Udodirim/PySales_Query_CLI

A command-line, modular, menu-driven application interface for querying, analyzing, and visualizing sales performance using Python, SQLite, and Matplotlib.

# **Road Accident Analytics & Risk Insights**
**Date: 2024**

**Project Overview**

This project analyzed road accident data to identify high-risk areas, contributing factors, and accident severity levels. Using exploratory analysis, risk modeling, and visualization, the findings provide actionable insights to inform targeted road safety interventions.


**Objectives**

- Identify accident hotspots and location-based risks.
- Analyze contributing factors such as road type, weather, and vehicle category.
- Understand accident severity levels (fatal, serious, slight).
- Provide recommendations for road safety strategies.


**Process**
- Data Collection – Acquired accident datasets.
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Structured raw records.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Uncovered key accident trends.
- Segmentation & Pattern Recognition – Grouped accidents by location, vehicle type, and conditions.
- Predictive Modeling – Forecasted accident risk factors.
- Risk Analysis – Quantified probability of accident severity.
- Visualization & Reporting – Built an interactive Road Accident Dashboard.
- Insights & Recommendations – Proposed strategies for intervention.


**Key Insights**
- Car-related accidents dominate, accounting for 79.8% of total casualties.
- Urban areas see higher accident rates (61%) compared to rural.
- Wet road surfaces contribute significantly to accident severity.
- Dark conditions increase risk, but daylight accidents are more frequent due to higher traffic.


**Impact**
- Informed road safety policies with data-backed insights.
- Identified accident hotspots for targeted interventions.
- Supported predictive risk assessment to reduce fatalities and casualties.
